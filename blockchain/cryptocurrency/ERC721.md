Non fungible token

> ERC20 tokens are fungible in nature, meaning that there isn’t a distinction between individual tokens. For example, if I have 100 metal marbles in my hand that are all the same size and color, it doesn’t matter which one I give you. In the same way, if I have 100 of the same ERC20 token, it doesn’t matter which one I give you. This contrasts with ERC721 tokens which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) such as CryptoKitties.
