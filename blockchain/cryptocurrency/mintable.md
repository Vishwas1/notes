Additional Features for ERC20 Tokens

In addition to the required functions, there are other features that ERC20 token contracts can add. The two primary ones are mintable and burnable tokens. Mintable tokens have a minting function that allows for the creation of additional tokens, meaning that the total supply is not fixed. The minting functions are usually only allowed to be called by a specific set of privileged addresses. While burnable tokens are the opposite in that they can be burned and the supply can be reduced when called by authorized addresses. It is also possible to have a contract that includes both minting and burning functionality.
