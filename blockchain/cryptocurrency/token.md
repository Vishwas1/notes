#  Asset-backed tokens

Asset backed tokens are claims on an underlying asset, from a specific issuer.

Wikipedia’s History of money suggests that in the good old days, you could park some gold with a goldsmith, and receive a receipt or “I Owe You” (IOU) note from them. These notes could be transferred from person to person, and anyone holding these notes could go back to the goldsmith and claim the actual gold.

Asset-backed tokens are the digital equivalent.

## What is the use of Token?

Just like a coin; a token can also be used as a medium of exchange. But apart from only being used as a means of payment; tokens also offers a wide range of functionalities. Their use cases are virtually limitless.

- A token is a digital asset which is issued by the project to be *used as a payment* within the projects ecosystem. 
- Other than this a token gives rights to holders to participate in the network. It can *give access to products or services*.
- A token *can represent a company’s share*.
- It can act as a digital *representation of a physical asset*.

## Different types of tokens

- Utility Tokens
- Security Tokens
- Asset Tokens
- Stablecoins
- Payment Tokens
- Equity Tokens
- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

Examples

- Tether (USDT) is a stable coin that is meant to mirror the value of US Dollar. Likewise USDC is a another fully collateralized US dollar stablecoin.
- Compound is a token that powers community governance of the compound protocol.
- Basic Attention Token is a payment token that is used within the Brave browser ecosystem.

## What is the need for a token since we already have coin?

Right now you must be wondering, if all these DAPPS are made in the Ethereum Network, then why don’t we simply use Ether to pay for every transaction within those DAPPS?

> The answer to that is pretty simple, even in real life, there are tons of places where we use a form of token over cash.

### Analogy

1. Remember that time you went to the water park? Remember how they took your money and tied a band around your wrist which you used to gain access to all the rides in the park and to buy food as well? *In this example the water park is the DAPP, your money is ether and the band is the token.*
2. How about the time you bought those movie tickets for Wonder Woman and included an extra popcorn and coke in your ticket? The moment you entered the theater how did you get in the hall? You showed them the ticket. How did you buy your popcorn and coke? Again, by showing them the ticket. *In this case, the cinema theater is the DAPP, your money is Ether and the ticket is the token.*


## How Does An ethereum Token Get Its Value?

**Supply & Demand**

>  More the demand and lesser the supply more will be the price of the product.

- Supply
    - As this code implies, there is a fixed amount of tokens that can be issued in the first place.
    -   ```
            function MyToken(uint256 initialSupply){
                balanceOf[msg.sender] = initialSupply
            }
        ```
- Demand
    - The demand obviously depends on a lot of factors. 
        - What is the quality of DAPP in itself? 
        - Are people excited about the DAPP? 
        - Has that DAPP been marketed properly? 
        - Is that DAPP going to solve problems? 
        - > If the demand of the DAPP is sufficiently high, and with the supply remaining constant, it goes without saying that the value of the token is going to be pretty high.
