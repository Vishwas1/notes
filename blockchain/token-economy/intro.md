[How come money came into existence](https://yos.io/2020/02/21/origin-of-money/)


 Liquid goods were better media of exchange.


 Thus, we can conclude that people are more willing to adopt a good as a medium of exchange depending on its physical durability and longevity. 

 Some other desirable properties would be its divisibility — tobacco can be divided into smaller quantities for smaller purchases much more easily than axes can be divided — its homogeneity, and its efficient market exchange value relative to its physical weight.


So I have these questions which I am trying to get answers:

a) Why people go crazy about NFTs or any cryptocurrency or tokens? 
b) What makes cryptocurrency so interesting among traders?
c) Why people are buying / selling it even if the do not need them (for example, NFTs)?


 So here is what I understood so far:

 1. Liquidity:

 Goods such as eggs and tobacco would have a wide market as opposed to goods such as horses and spears, meaning that many people in the community regularly want to acquire them in trade.

 2. Network effect

 The tobacco farmer heading to market is already in a strong bargaining position because plenty of smokers are probably at that very moment heading to buy tobacco. Even nonsmokers (possible answer to question c) heading to market may be willing to trade their goods for tobacco, so long as the goods they start with are less liquid than tobacco.

 3. Divisibility

 tobacco can be divided into smaller quantities for smaller purchases much more easily than eggs can be divided 

 --- 

 But the question is, all these feature (Liquidity, Divisibility,Network effect ) are also provided by nativ currency like dollar or rupee, what makes cryptocurreny special?

 *Ease of trade* is possible one factor behind it. Trading native currency comes with monetering /policing by states where as cryptocurreny are not just fairly easy to trade but also have not boundries or restrictions.

 The state can have an impact on the value of regular currency. They can "devalue" it for example or peg it to another currency or good. Cryptocurrency value is determined by the participants, miners and mathematics.
