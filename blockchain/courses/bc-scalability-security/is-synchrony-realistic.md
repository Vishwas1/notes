## Is synchrony realistic?

In this module, we will explore whether the  synchrony assumption we made earlier is actually realistic.


We will cover the causes of network delays on the Internet, and explain the risks associated with  hese. 


We will also look at two attacks against proof-of-work blockchains: 
- the balance attack that allows to double-spend without a large portion of the mining power and
- the man-in-the-middle attack that can be used against Ethereum. 


## synchrony

 all mes-sages must be transmitted in a known bounded time.


 There are two assumptions that underpin communication synchrony. 
 
 - One of these assumptions is that every message gets delivered in a maximum amount of time.
 - That max amount of time is known to the algorithm.


## Balance Attack


we will discuss how one can double spent
without owning a large portion of
the mining power in proof of work blockchains. 

This means that an attacker with
low mining power can exploit network delays to succeed. 

They can affect the blockchains based on proof-of-work, meaning the attacker with low mining power can exploit network delays to succeed.
