## Extended Triple Diffie Hellman 

X3DH establishes a shared secret key between two parties who mutually authenticate each other based on public keys. 

X3DH provides forward secrecy and cryptographic deniability (?).

> [Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)](https://www.forwardsecrecy.com/) refers to the notion that compromise of a *single key will permit access to only data protected by a single key*. 

Or in other words:

> The concept of *Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)* is the property that ensures that a session key derived from a set of long-term public and private keys will not be compromised if one of the (long-term) private keys is compromised in the future.
