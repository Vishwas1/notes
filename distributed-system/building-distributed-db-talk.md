Blockchain is multi leader relicated system? 


look for [sharding system](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/02/ethereum-scalability-research-development-subsidy-programs/) for hypersign enterprise

caveats

- Running query across shards will be difficult
- Join query will be difficult

#bolt 

distributed hash table
